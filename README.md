# Pyfetch

Pyfetch is a cross-platform fetch tool made in Python currently WIP and not usable yet that includes or will include a library for fetching data from Linux and one with the same objective but for Windows

#### Additional thanks:

[Phate6660](https://github.com/Phate6660) for encouraging me into making this and helping me understand more about how linux works with [rsfetch](https://github.com/Phate6660/rsfetch)
